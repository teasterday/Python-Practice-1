  ### üè† Take-Home Challenge: My Intro Script

  Create a script called `my_intro_script.py` that:

  * Asks the user for their name, favorite food, and a number
  * Prints a few fun sentences using the answers
  * Uses string concatenation and at least one string method
  * Includes 2 comments to explain your code

  **Example Output:**

  ```
  What is your name? Travis
  What's your favorite food? tacos
  Pick a number: 3

  Hello Travis!
  Wow, 3 tacos sounds great!
  TRAVIS really likes tacos.
  ```
