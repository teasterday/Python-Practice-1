  ### üè† Take-Home Challenge: My Intro Script


  Create a script called `my_intro_script.py` that:


  * Asks the user for their name, favorite food, and a number

  * Prints a few fun sentences using the answers

  * Uses string concatenation and at least one string method

  * Includes 2 comments to explain your code


  **Example Output:**


  ```

  What is your name? Travis

  What's your favorite food? tacos

  Pick a number: 3


  Hello Travis!

  Wow, 3 tacos sounds great!

  TRAVIS really likes tacos.

  ```
